# Linear mixed models

## Motivation

Random effects are a very common addition to regression models that are used to account for grouping (categorical) variables such as subject, year, location. To explain the motivation for these models, as well as the basic syntax, we will use an example data set containing exam scores of 4,059 students from 65 schools in Inner London. This data set is located in the R package `mlmRev`.

-   Response: "normexam" (Normalized exam score).
-   Predictor 1: "standLRT" (Standardised LR test score; Reading test taken when they were 11 years old).
-   Predictor 2: "sex" of the student (F / M).
-   Grouping factor: school

If we analyze this with a simple LM, we see that reading ability and sex have the expected effects on the exam score.

```{r chunk_chapter4_chunk24, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(mlmRev)
library(effects)

mod0 = lm(normexam ~ standLRT + sex , data = Exam)
plot(allEffects(mod0))
```
